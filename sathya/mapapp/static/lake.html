        Chembarambakkam Lake is one of the largest lakes in the Chennai metropolitan area, located about 40 kilometers southwest of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. It serves as a major source of drinking water for the city and its surrounding regions, making it a critical component of Chennai’s water supply system. The lake is fed by the rainfall in the Western Ghats and the surrounding catchment areas.

Spanning several square kilometers, Chembarambakkam Lake not only provides water for domestic use but also supports irrigation and groundwater recharge for nearby agricultural lands. The lake’s embankments and bunds are well-maintained to manage water storage and prevent flooding during the monsoon season. Local authorities closely monitor the water levels and quality to ensure a consistent supply for the city.

The lake also plays an important ecological role, serving as a habitat for various migratory birds, fish, and other aquatic life. During the monsoon, it becomes a serene natural spot, attracting nature enthusiasts and photographers. With increasing urbanization, Chembarambakkam Lake remains a lifeline for Chennai, highlighting the importance of preserving and managing freshwater resources efficiently for future generations.
